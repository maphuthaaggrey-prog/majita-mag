     { question: "Photography Journey", answer: "My journey began back in 2013, I remember I had just bought myself a smart phone that I wouldn’t mention its exact name, I started exploring photography making use of that phone device. I’d shoot pictures and they would appear as if I was using a digital camera. This was only a passion until I realised that I should actually turn in a full time career, that’s when I started to enrol at Tshwane University of Technology under the faculty of arts. That’s where I got my qualification in advanced photography, a period of 4 years studying a picture."},
     { question: "How did you know this was for you", answer: "I knew this was for me when everytime we went out with friends and family, I was always the only taking them pictures, I’m never on the pictures with them but behind the camera, even though I was using a cellphone but I was taking very good pictures that no one could ever think of."},
     { question: "Which lens do you use most often, and why?", answer: "I think every professional photographer would attest to this that a 50mm lens is a must have, you can’t go without it. The depth of field is incredible, I’m talking aperture of f1.8 giving you a minimal focus to the subject and more light into the frame."},
     { question: "How do you capture great photos in low-light or tricky lighting?", answer: "Always balance your f-stop with your shutter speed, and your ISO should never exceed 400, actually try to keep it at 100, that’s what reduces grain or noise in the photograph. Remember ISO deals with the noise, while f-stop deal with the amount of light that goes on the lens and shutter speed deals with the speed you’d want the picture to be captured at."},
     { question: "What does photography mean to you on a personal level?", answer: "Photography it's theraphy to me, it heals my broken soul. I would be going through it all and just a look of my catalogue I get so much joy instantly" },
     { question: "Favorite Picture and story behind", answer:[{ image:somethingTallFavPicture}, "The story behind this picture is amazing, this is the horizons, feels like the heavens meet earth, it was 19:45pm at Camps bay, Cape Town. Few minutes just before sunset, the view is breathtaking. This was wellorchestrated, I had to plan this and also be on time and stand on the correct angle."] },
     { question: "What inspired you to host a soccer tournament, and what did the experience mean to you?", answer: ["Most people were and are still looking out for me as their role model. I figured it would mean a lot to actually bring the community together in terms of soccer tournament. It was a such a great experience living in such moment, I'm glad the public engaged and connected well with it. They supported it from the start and they are looking for the 2nd one which will take place in the following year."] },
     { question: "Common mistakes beginner photographers make, and how can they avoid them?", answer: ["Most beginners are arrogant, they don't wanna learn. They literally wanna run before they could even crawl or walk. Another mistake they make is to start making their service known to the public without fully knowing the technical requirements of photography. Some don't even know the basic needs of photography. I wanna tell you that being a professional photographer has nothing to do with taking a picture. Taking a picture is probably 2 percent of being a photographer, the remaining 98 percent is what beginners avoid, which is being a professional."] },
     { question: "Is formal education or hands-on experience more important in photography?", answer: ["Education is very important, don't even be told otherwise, I also thought I knew photography until I went to school, that's when I realized that I know nothing. School will sharpen your mind, be it photography or anything else. You can be an experienced photographer but lacking professionalism. I see most beginners are doing it. They lack such professionalism and discipline."] },
     { question: "Future plans", answer: ["My future plans is to teach photography, well I'm already doing it, but I wanna do it on a professional level. There are people that I've mentored and still mentoring some at the moment, also to build a first ever photography studio in my community."] }

     {question: "Who are you?", answer: "My name is Corey and I'm an all rounder Creative from Ga Masemola in Malope basically I'm into anything that has to do with creativity from Creative Directing to CopyWriting, Hosting Events and I used to make music. I define creativity as your imagination, I define it as the thoughts you have when you're alone and turning them into reality.I get creative in everything I do on a daily basis, whether it's work or personal. For example I believe creativity is everything and almost everyone can become a creative, you see how you fold your clothes ? That's creativity or maybe that's just me seeing it with a creative eye so to me this comes naturally."},
     {question: "What sparked your passion for creativity, and how has it evolved over time?", answer: "2. I grew up in a very artistic family where I had 2 family members who were making music and one time they came with beats and said to me that I must write something on it and I think that's what sparked the creative in me because I was already a dancer at that point then transitioned into making music from making music I went to clothing. The clothing journey began when I started drawing logos even though I knew I was not that good with drawing, so there this dude in my class who was great with drawing and he took my sketches and re-drew them and they came out how I envisioned them and basically that's where I discovered my Creative Directing skills and from there I went to creative direct a lot of stuff from logos to clothing and event production (banners to stage arrangements etc) and from clothing I went to events, the events journey started when me and my team had an idea to launch our brand and for that to be possible we had to host a launch event and it became a success, it being a success opened more doors to host other events and now we are here."},
     {question: "What is your best project so far and why?", answer: ["My best project so far is an event called Food Garden 1060 that happens annually on the 24th of December and we were just celebrating 5 years of that marvellous event last year, I have to say I'm super proud of my team. Without them honestly I don't think I would be as great as I am right now as a creative and they bring out the best in me so yea Food Garden best respresents me as a creative looking at how far we came from just us using pallets and black chairs to upgrading to umbrellas and benches. I honestly wouldn't want to indulge more into this because I might spill a few secrets or rather what is coming but the vision is clear everyone can see where the event is heading and the creativity of setting up the event comes from the people, it comes from how I envision the people would like to sit around you know ? This goes back to me saying creativity is your imagination, everything you see at this event is my imagination and that of my team.", { image: coreyPic}] },
     {question: "Creative adaption and challenges", answer: ["In terms of challenges I face them everyday or every project. If you're in the creative space you know this, for example last year we didn't have sufficient stage production items and I had to take some items from our photo booth and put them on stage, also a creative without any sponsor so we lack funds for certain things and this is where you have to apply your creative mind another example was having to make a banner with a cloth and paints. This will always be a great experience to me because it helps me to think on my feet"] },
     {question: "Looking ahead, what are your hopes and aspirations for the future of creativity, both personally and within the broader creative community", answer: ["Right now what I am looking forward to is just expanding into different parts of creativity and do somethings that I haven't done before, I forgot to mentioned that I was also a blogger before so I interviewed Creatives in a form of a blog and I have always wanted to make it a visual thing so that's also something I would like to tap into and in the creative community I'm looking forward to collaborations man because I think as a unit we could make big moves, whether it's Music, Events or Clothing but I believe collaborations can take us further, if we can make big moves independently then imagine the ones we can do as a collective." ] }

I'm passionate about my craft, dedicated to making my mark in 1060 hip-hop, and always cooking up in the stu with my team."},
        { question: "What inspired me", answer: "Growing up in a musical family inspired me to become a music producer. I used to watch legendary 1060 producers, like Divinzo and Master V, making house music at my mom's house when I was just a kid. That's how I got started becoming a music producer and making house music too. Later, in 2015 (those Juice Back and Roll Up times), I transitioned from making house music to creating hip-hop beats, influenced by my brother, Notorioux, who I used to watch making hip-hop beats all the time."},
        { question: "Where do you get your inspiration for your beat and melodies?", answer: "I find inspiration for my beats and melodies by listening to songs, from old school classics to new releases. Lately I love digging through old school jams to find the perfect samples to flip and make my own. Even listening to a new song today can give me an idea and push me to create something similar, yet unique. That's why I'm confident that my sound will never expire and will constantly evolve."},
        { question: "Can you share a time when a project didn't go as planned and how did you handle it.", answer: "Lol. About 85% of the songs on my 'For The Win EP' didn't go as planned. We faced challenges like limited studio equipment and artists failing to submit their verses on time. But I didn't let that hold me back. I found solutions by filling the gaps with my talented team. The project turned out amazing, and the final product was fire! Huge shoutout to Germtee for the equipment, Manila R and everyone involved in the project."},
        { question: "Is there a particular song you most proud of and why", answer: "I'm proud of all the work I've produced, but I'm most proud of the 'For The Win Project'. I believe it's the only project that brought together almost every hip-hop artist in 1060. My vision was to feature even more, but unfortunately, equipment limitations held me back. But still, the project's impact make it my number one accomplishment." },
        { question: "Who are your biggest musical influences", answer: ["Lol. My musical influences change daily. I might wake up feeling inspired by Kanye West one day, MashBeatz the next, and then switch to someone entirely different the day after. This is actually what keeps my sound versatile." ]},

I've always loved Hip Hop music since a young age from the influence of my big brother, but it was my cousin Manila who actually introduced me to the mic. It started off as just goofing around on beats but later got serious with time when we met and started working with the two talented producer brothers DaNotoriux Beats and Veteran Beatx, forming and introducing the group Left In The Dark(LITD). It's been bar after bar, record after record, freestyle after freestyle, feature after feature, performance after performance, and smash hit after smash hit ever since."},
            { question: "Favorite Part About Being A Musician", answer: "My main favourite part about being a musician, a rapper is that I never have to bottle up emotions inside. I express my feelings, emotions, and experiences on these beats. My other favourite part is the creative process - engaging with producers to find dope beats, having studio sessions, smoke sessions, writing on beats, having listening sessions, and definitely the performance part. I've always been one with Hip Hop, and having the ability to create my own songs from scratch (with the help of other pivotal members of the crew) is definitely a blessing from above, so basically my favourite part about being a musician is simply doing it (what musicians do - make music). The impact of music on the world is what makes me feel passionate about it"},

I'm currently dropping freestyles left and right trying to gain more traction and followers on my social media profiles, special S/O to Tsheamor Studios for helping out.

So I wanted to share out the whole experiece to everyone, started off as a hip hop hip hop DJ then ventured into different genres as time goes. All of this happened in a very short span of time. From being a DJ, I needed to be more and deeply connected to the feeling then that's where I started producing beats for multiple artists both local and upcoming, many projects as a ghost-writer.

I've always wanted to be part of VIP Milan SA ever since, simply because I liked the way the organisation handles its projects, the lifestyle and its professionalism, I just didn't have any experience at the time.

        When you're fire-fighting your "To Do" list is often swirling around in your head. Take control and write everything down. In times of intense pressure, you'll need to prioritise and rank your items in order of importance. A priority matrix is often really helpful here. Never the easiest thing for event organisers to do.

Some places definitely require you to arrive on scene well in advance and take a few tester shots just to make sure that post production is made easier. Final images like I said, earlier will never really come out the way you wanted them to the first time around and so they always require you to take multiple shots, different angles, different lighting and finally deciding on which one suits your idea and conception best."},

So basically as an artist one of the difficulty thing is you can't full express yourself if you not financially ok, you'll always have to compromise, which is something that it's not full quraantee. today theres alot of people creating art, which makes it a bit harder to break through if you creating something someone has already seen on a platform where people just like an scroll past. Also people gate keeping art events and call outs to galleries, we could work together and make southie art infested that way more culture can be expressed through the expansion of artist in thesespaces."]},

            { question:"What motivated you to start your own barbershop?", answer: "My barbershop adventure started in high school, I think the main aim of starting it was because I wanted to earn some extra money. At first, it was tough getting customers, and I wasn't super motivated because of various reasons, But when people started taking a liking to my work and saying nice things about it, it made me feel good. I realized that I had a talent that could make people happy and look good. And when people from other kasi's came to my barbershop, it showed me that my skills were reaching far and wide. With more and more people coming in, I decided to grow my business. Each new customer boosted my confidence and made me want to work even harder. Looking back now, I'm thankful for the journey and all the lessons learned. My barbershop isn't just a place to get a haircut - it's a reminder of how believing in yourself and your talents can lead you to something great."},
            { question:"How did you go about turning your passion for barbering into a business?", answer: "Well, When I was a kid I was always into finding ways to make money. Back in primary school I started by selling mangoes, and naartjies(dinarekisi) from my Aunt's garden. Then later on I got into fixing bikes, and funny enough, people even started to call me 'Mr. Fix'. And That's when I realized I actually enjoy running my own show. And now, here I am, with my very own barber Salon."},
            { question:"What were some of the challenges you faced when starting your barbershop, and how did you overcome them?", answer: "The challenges I've faced have been tough. People would often say I was too young for the job, doubting my skills and ability to cut hair properly. Some even thought I'd mess up their hair completely. And I don't blame them because back then, I didn't have all the right equipment, and my workspace wasn't exactly ideal. But despite all that, my determination kept me going. For every negative comment, there were also positive ones that encouraged me to push harder and do better. They're the ones that gave me the energy to build something bigger and better out of this passion."},
            { question:"What advice would you give to someone thinking about starting their own barbershop?", answer: "Building a successful barbershop takes time and effort. Stay committed to your vision, even when faced with challenges or setbacks, keep pushing forward. And you'll eventual see results. Believe in Yourself, Don't let doubts hold you back. Trust in your skills and passion for barbering, even if others doubt you because of your age or experience. Start Small, Dream Big, Begin with what you have and expand from that. You don't nee fancy equipment or a perfect workspace to start. Just focus on providing excellent service and building a loyal clientele. And always remember, both positive and negative feedbacks can be valuable. Use criticism as motivation to improve."},

I was fascinated by the process of crafting beats, melodies, and harmonies that could move people. Producing influenced my deejaying in many ways. It allowed me to develop a deeper understanding of music structure, arrangement, and mixing. I started to appreciate the intricacies of a well-crafted track and how it could elevate a DJ set.

        { question: "How do you come up with fresh ideas for content that truly connects with your audience?", answer: `I always make sure I am up to date with the latest trends, this ensures that I always
                                            produce content that relates to what most people are currently into. I also always focus
                                            on analytics of my content and how well my different videos and posts are doing to

                                               majority of us as women create similar content, especially student women creators,
                                               this people get tired of seeing the same type of content from all the creators which
                                               sometimes may result in less engagement on my videos, but I learned that staying true
                                               to who I am and not trying to steal other people's aesthetic or creation styles ensures
                                               that my content reaches people who enjoy my unique style of content and my energy
                                               in my videos. Within the nightlife scene the biggest challenge is dealing with the
                                               different stigmas that are associated with women who work within the nightlife scene,
                                               from being accused of being gold-diggers or being pimps, the list goes on. And in all
                                               honesty, these are stigmas that will be around for a while, my best is to just ignore all

                                                    creation and club promotion are not the type of industries where you just win easily,

                                                majority of my audience being students automatically means my content must relate

        { question: "Have your studies helped you improve your work as a content creator and promoter in any way?", answer: [`Funny enough my studies and what I do on the side a just two opposite things, my
                                                studies do not relate to my content creation and nightlife life, so my studies have never

                                                in general I ALWAYS LISTEN TO MY BODY, if my body is exhausted, I take a break

        { question: "What message would you give to young women who struggle with confidence and self-worth in a world that demands perfection?", answer: [`My message would be to learn to love yourself first, a lot of women want to be loved
                                                by the world before they even love themselves and that’s why their confidence and
                                                self-esteem are always low. Take the time of social media, disconnect from the world
