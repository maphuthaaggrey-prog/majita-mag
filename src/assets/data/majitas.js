     { question: "Photography Journey", answer: "My journey began back in 2013, I remember I had just bought myself a smart phone that I wouldn’t mention its exact name, I started exploring photography making use of that phone device. I’d shoot pictures and they would appear as if I was using a digital camera. This was only a passion until I realised that I should actually turn in a full time career, that’s when I started to enrol at Tshwane University of Technology under the faculty of arts. That’s where I got my qualification in advanced photography, a period of 4 years studying a picture."},
     { question: "How did you know this was for you", answer: "I knew this was for me when everytime we went out with friends and family, I was always the only taking them pictures, I’m never on the pictures with them but behind the camera, even though I was using a cellphone but I was taking very good pictures that no one could ever think of."},
     { question: "Which lens do you use most often, and why?", answer: "I think every professional photographer would attest to this that a 50mm lens is a must have, you can’t go without it. The depth of field is incredible, I’m talking aperture of f1.8 giving you a minimal focus to the subject and more light into the frame."},
     { question: "How do you capture great photos in low-light or tricky lighting?", answer: "Always balance your f-stop with your shutter speed, and your ISO should never exceed 400, actually try to keep it at 100, that’s what reduces grain or noise in the photograph. Remember ISO deals with the noise, while f-stop deal with the amount of light that goes on the lens and shutter speed deals with the speed you’d want the picture to be captured at."},
     { question: "What does photography mean to you on a personal level?", answer: "Photography it's theraphy to me, it heals my broken soul. I would be going through it all and just a look of my catalogue I get so much joy instantly" },
     { question: "Favorite Picture and story behind", answer:[{ image:somethingTallFavPicture}, "The story behind this picture is amazing, this is the horizons, feels like the heavens meet earth, it was 19:45pm at Camps bay, Cape Town. Few minutes just before sunset, the view is breathtaking. This was wellorchestrated, I had to plan this and also be on time and stand on the correct angle."] },
     { question: "What inspired you to host a soccer tournament, and what did the experience mean to you?", answer: ["Most people were and are still looking out for me as their role model. I figured it would mean a lot to actually bring the community together in terms of soccer tournament. It was a such a great experience living in such moment, I'm glad the public engaged and connected well with it. They supported it from the start and they are looking for the 2nd one which will take place in the following year."] },
     { question: "Common mistakes beginner photographers make, and how can they avoid them?", answer: ["Most beginners are arrogant, they don't wanna learn. They literally wanna run before they could even crawl or walk. Another mistake they make is to start making their service known to the public without fully knowing the technical requirements of photography. Some don't even know the basic needs of photography. I wanna tell you that being a professional photographer has nothing to do with taking a picture. Taking a picture is probably 2 percent of being a photographer, the remaining 98 percent is what beginners avoid, which is being a professional."] },
     { question: "Is formal education or hands-on experience more important in photography?", answer: ["Education is very important, don't even be told otherwise, I also thought I knew photography until I went to school, that's when I realized that I know nothing. School will sharpen your mind, be it photography or anything else. You can be an experienced photographer but lacking professionalism. I see most beginners are doing it. They lack such professionalism and discipline."] },
     { question: "Future plans", answer: ["My future plans is to teach photography, well I'm already doing it, but I wanna do it on a professional level. There are people that I've mentored and still mentoring some at the moment, also to build a first ever photography studio in my community."] }

     {question: "Who are you?", answer: "My name is Corey and I'm an all rounder Creative from Ga Masemola in Malope basically I'm into anything that has to do with creativity from Creative Directing to CopyWriting, Hosting Events and I used to make music. I define creativity as your imagination, I define it as the thoughts you have when you're alone and turning them into reality.I get creative in everything I do on a daily basis, whether it's work or personal. For example I believe creativity is everything and almost everyone can become a creative, you see how you fold your clothes ? That's creativity or maybe that's just me seeing it with a creative eye so to me this comes naturally."},
     {question: "What sparked your passion for creativity, and how has it evolved over time?", answer: "2. I grew up in a very artistic family where I had 2 family members who were making music and one time they came with beats and said to me that I must write something on it and I think that's what sparked the creative in me because I was already a dancer at that point then transitioned into making music from making music I went to clothing. The clothing journey began when I started drawing logos even though I knew I was not that good with drawing, so there this dude in my class who was great with drawing and he took my sketches and re-drew them and they came out how I envisioned them and basically that's where I discovered my Creative Directing skills and from there I went to creative direct a lot of stuff from logos to clothing and event production (banners to stage arrangements etc) and from clothing I went to events, the events journey started when me and my team had an idea to launch our brand and for that to be possible we had to host a launch event and it became a success, it being a success opened more doors to host other events and now we are here."},
     {question: "What is your best project so far and why?", answer: ["My best project so far is an event called Food Garden 1060 that happens annually on the 24th of December and we were just celebrating 5 years of that marvellous event last year, I have to say I'm super proud of my team. Without them honestly I don't think I would be as great as I am right now as a creative and they bring out the best in me so yea Food Garden best respresents me as a creative looking at how far we came from just us using pallets and black chairs to upgrading to umbrellas and benches. I honestly wouldn't want to indulge more into this because I might spill a few secrets or rather what is coming but the vision is clear everyone can see where the event is heading and the creativity of setting up the event comes from the people, it comes from how I envision the people would like to sit around you know ? This goes back to me saying creativity is your imagination, everything you see at this event is my imagination and that of my team.", { image: coreyPic}] },
     {question: "Creative adaption and challenges", answer: ["In terms of challenges I face them everyday or every project. If you're in the creative space you know this, for example last year we didn't have sufficient stage production items and I had to take some items from our photo booth and put them on stage, also a creative without any sponsor so we lack funds for certain things and this is where you have to apply your creative mind another example was having to make a banner with a cloth and paints. This will always be a great experience to me because it helps me to think on my feet"] },
     {question: "Looking ahead, what are your hopes and aspirations for the future of creativity, both personally and within the broader creative community", answer: ["Right now what I am looking forward to is just expanding into different parts of creativity and do somethings that I haven't done before, I forgot to mentioned that I was also a blogger before so I interviewed Creatives in a form of a blog and I have always wanted to make it a visual thing so that's also something I would like to tap into and in the creative community I'm looking forward to collaborations man because I think as a unit we could make big moves, whether it's Music, Events or Clothing but I believe collaborations can take us further, if we can make big moves independently then imagine the ones we can do as a collective." ] }

I used to watch legendary 1060 producers, like Divinzo and Master V, making house music at my mom's house when I was just a kid. That's how I got started becoming a music producer and making house music too. Later, in 2015 (those Juice Back and Roll Up times), I transitioned from making house music to creating hip-hop beats, influenced by my brother, Notorioux, who I used to watch making hip-hop beats all the time."},
        { question: "Where do you get your inspiration for your beat and melodies?", answer: "I find inspiration for my beats and melodies by listening to songs, from old school classics to new releases. Lately I love digging through old school jams to find the perfect samples to flip and make my own. Even listening to a new song today can give me an idea and push me to create something similar, yet unique. That's why I'm confident that my sound will never expire and will constantly evolve."},
        { question: "Can you share a time when a project didn't go as planned and how did you handle it.", answer: "Lol. About 85% of the songs on my 'For The Win EP' didn't go as planned. We faced challenges like limited studio equipment and artists failing to submit their verses on time. But I didn't let that hold me back. I found solutions by filling the gaps with my talented team. The project turned out amazing, and the final product was fire! Huge shoutout to Germtee for the equipment, Manila R and everyone involved in the project."},
        { question: "Is there a particular song you most proud of and why", answer: "I'm proud of all the work I've produced, but I'm most proud of the 'For The Win Project'. I believe it's the only project that brought together almost every hip-hop artist in 1060. My vision was to feature even more, but unfortunately, equipment limitations held me back. But still, the project's impact make it my number one accomplishment." },

I might wake up feeling inspired by Kanye West one day, MashBeatz the next, and then switch to someone entirely different the day after. This is actually what keeps my sound versatile." ]},

It started off as just goofing around on beats but later got serious with time when we met and started working with the two talented producer brothers DaNotoriux Beats and Veteran Beatx, forming and introducing the group Left In The Dark(LITD). It's been bar after bar, record after record, freestyle after freestyle, feature after feature, performance after performance, and smash hit after smash hit ever since."},

I express my feelings, emotions, and experiences on these beats. My other favourite part is the creative process - engaging with producers to find dope beats, having studio sessions, smoke sessions, writing on beats, having listening sessions, and definitely the performance part. I've always been one with Hip Hop, and having the ability to create my own songs from scratch (with the help of other pivotal members of the crew) is definitely a blessing from above, so basically my favourite part about being a musician is simply doing it (what musicians do - make music).

From being a DJ, I needed to be more and deeply connected to the feeling then that's where I started producing beats for multiple artists both local and upcoming, many projects as a ghost-writer.

        When you're fire-fighting your "To Do" list is often swirling around in your head. Take control and write everything down. In times of intense pressure, you'll need to prioritise and rank your items in order of importance. A priority matrix is often really helpful here. Never the easiest thing for event organisers to do. But to ensure you stay calm and manage important tasks effectively, see which of the less important tasks you can farm out to somebody else.`},
        { question: "Stylist", answer: "Be yourself, I stay true to my identity, my values, my vision, and not following the trends blindly. You can use the trends as a source of inspiration, but not as a limitation or a constraint. Knowing your style will help you filter out the trends that are not compatible with your aesthetic and per- sonality, and focus on the ones that enhance and complement your look."},
        { question: "Influential", answer: "The first step to increasing your influence is to build connections. I keep learning, I volunteer my time, I experience new things and places, and I get creative."},

I started my own company 'Cocktail Cafe' year 2021. I used to work as a barten- der and I've learned a lot about cocktails so I saw an opportunity to start my own company. Some of the early challenges I've faced was having limited equipment. Having limited resources forces you to have few options on the menu" },
        { question: "Growth", answer: ["Personal growth to me means having a lifelong learning mentality about myself, diving deep into who I am and what makes me tick, and making sure that I'm also recognizing where I want to go and figuring out how to get there and making sure I'm keeping myself accountable to the things that I'm doing in my everyday life. As a being I believe we need to prioritize personal growth because you are the one responsible for what you are. Make your health a priority."] },

Some places definitely require you to arrive on scene well in advance and take a few tester shots just to make sure that post production is made easier.

So basically as an artist one of the difficulty thing is you can't full express yourself if you not financially ok, you'll always have to compromise, which is something that it's not full quraantee. today theres alot of people creating art, which makes it a bit harder to break through if you creating something someone has already seen on a platform where people just like an scroll past. Also people gate keeping art events and call outs to galleries, we could work together and make southie art infested that way more culture can be expressed through the expansion of artist in thesespaces."]},

            { question:"What motivated you to start your own barbershop?", answer: "My barbershop adventure started in high school, I think the main aim of starting it was because I wanted to earn some extra money. At first, it was tough getting customers, and I wasn't super motivated because of various reasons, But when people started taking a liking to my work and saying nice things about it, it made me feel good. I realized that I had a talent that could make people happy and look good. And when people from other kasi's came to my barbershop, it showed me that my skills were reaching far and wide. With more and more people coming in, I decided to grow my business. Each new customer boosted my confidence and made me want to work even harder. Looking back now, I'm thankful for the journey and all the lessons learned. My barbershop isn't just a place to get a haircut - it's a reminder of how believing in yourself and your talents can lead you to something great."},
            { question:"How did you go about turning your passion for barbering into a business?", answer: "Well, When I was a kid I was always into finding ways to make money. Back in primary school I started by selling mangoes, and naartjies(dinarekisi) from my Aunt's garden. Then later on I got into fixing bikes, and funny enough, people even started to call me 'Mr. Fix'. And That's when I realized I actually enjoy running my own show. And now, here I am, with my very own barber Salon."},
            { question:"What were some of the challenges you faced when starting your barbershop, and how did you overcome them?", answer: "The challenges I've faced have been tough. People would often say I was too young for the job, doubting my skills and ability to cut hair properly. Some even thought I'd mess up their hair completely. And I don't blame them because back then, I didn't have all the right equipment, and my workspace wasn't exactly ideal. But despite all that, my determination kept me going. For every negative comment, there were also positive ones that encouraged me to push harder and do better. They're the ones that gave me the energy to build something bigger and better out of this passion."},

Stay committed to your vision, even when faced with challenges or setbacks, keep pushing forward. And you'll eventual see results. Believe in Yourself, Don't let doubts hold you back. Trust in your skills and passion for barbering, even if others doubt you because of your age or experience. Start Small, Dream Big, Begin with what you have and expand from that. You don't nee fancy equipment or a perfect workspace to start. Just focus on providing excellent service and building a loyal clientele. And always remember, both positive and negative feedbacks can be valuable. Use criticism as motivation to improve."},

                                            produce content that relates to what most people are currently into. I also always focus

                                               sometimes may result in less engagement on my videos, but I learned that staying true
                                               to who I am and not trying to steal other people's aesthetic or creation styles ensures

                                               in my videos. Within the nightlife scene the biggest challenge is dealing with the

        questions: [
        {question: "How would you define your sound, and what genres do you explore the most? ", answer: "My sound is a fusion of traditional South African rhythms with modern styles, blending the old with the new. I explore genres like Amapiano, Afro-pop, and Hip-hop, often incorporating elements of folk and R&B. My music is a reflection of my roots and experiences, with a focus on storytelling and emotional depth. I aim to create a unique sound that's both authentic and innovative, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in South African music."},
        {question: "What was the turning point that made you realize music was your path, and how has that journey shaped the artist you are today?", answer: `For me, the turning point was a moment of raw emotion and vulnerability. I was going through a tough time, and music became my escape, my confidant, and my voice. I remember writing a song during that period, and it was like the words just flowed out of me, tapping into a deep well of feelings and experiences. When I shared that song with others, their reactions were overwhelming – they connected with it on a level that resonated deeply.

                    That moment made me realize that music wasn't just something I did; it was a part of who I am. It was a way to express myself, to tell stories that needed to be told, and to connect with others on a fundamental level. From then on, I dedicated myself to honing my craft, experimenting with different sounds, and pushing myself to grow as an artist.

                    That journey has shaped me into the artist I am today by teaching me the importance of authenticity, resilience, and connection. I've learned to stay true to myself, to take risks, and to trust my instincts. The ups and downs, the triumphs and setbacks – they've all contributed to my growth and my unique perspective. Today, I'm driven by a passion to create music that not only reflects my own experiences but also resonates with others, leaving a lasting impact.`},

        {question: "How do you ensure that your music stays authentic while adapting to different sounds and trends? ", answer: [`For me, authenticity is key. I focus on staying true to my core values, emotions, and experiences.
                    Here's how I approach it: 
                    I draw inspiration from my upbringing, culture, and personal experiences. This helps me stay grounded and authentic, even when exploring new sounds. 
                    I experiment with new styles and trends, but within boundaries that feel true to my artistic vision. This way, I can innovate without compromising my authenticity or losing my unique voice.`] },

        {question: "How do you balance being an artist and being relatable to your audience?", answer: [`You know, as an artist, I'm always looking for ways to express myself and connect with my audience on a deeper level. Music is a huge part of that, but I've also been inspired by the idea of sharing my life experiences, passions, and interests with my fans.` ] },
        {question: "Do you think lifestyle content is a natural extension of your music or is it its own separate creative space? ", answer: [`For me, lifestyle content is a natural extension of my music. It's a way to share the other sides of my personality and creativity, whether that's through fashion, travel, food, or just everyday life. I think it's really helped me build a stronger connection with my fans and give them a more well-rounded view of who I am as an artist.

Plus, exploring lifestyle content has allowed me to tap into my curiosity and creativity in new ways. It's been really fun to experiment with different formats and styles, and to see how I can use lifestyle content to enhance my music and vice versa.

Ultimately, I think it's all about sharing my authentic self with my audience and giving them a reason to engage with me on a deeper level. Whether it's through my music or my lifestyle content, I want to inspire and connect with people in a meaningful way.`] }

        {question: "How did your journey in photography and content creation begin?", answer: `It all started in 2022 when I was consuming a lot of YouTube content from creators like Thato Rampedi, so it went from “I enjoy watching content” to “I want to create this kind of content” and on some day in 2023 after I got my first phone with a good camera quality, I just decided let me shoot and from there, I’ve been at it. `},
        {question: "What style of photography do you gravitate towards and why?", answer: ["The kind of photography that I enjoy wholeheartedly is Landscape/nature photography but the one that I gravitate towards the most is portrait photography because it’s much easier to generate income from it, in comparison to landscape/nature photography. "] },
        {question: "Can you describe one of your most memorable shoots?", answer: [`My most memorable shoots was nerve wrecking, I was at the verge of refunding my client because I thought the pictures were not good enough. It was my first ever payed graduation shoot, so I was doubting myself a lot. I decided to send the pictures to my client and surprisingly, she was very much happy with them. `] },
        {question: "How do you balance creativity with client expectations?", answer: ["The balance between my creativity and client expectations is the hardest thing about photography because you never know if you’re being too creative or what. How I balance the two, I make sure to send samples to my client to try give them the freedom of deciding what they would like as the final product." ] },
        {question: "Do you prefer shooting events, portraits or lifestyle content and what draws you to it?", answer: [`I prefer lifestyle content over every thing because it’s a ‘lifestyle ‘ it feels natural.` ] },
        {question: "What's one thing people misunderstand about being a photographer?", answer: [`People always expect you to have good pictures of yourself because you’re a photographer and you’re expected to be photogenic. `] },
        {question: "How do you come up with content ideas that resonate with your audience?", answer: [`I believe I shoot relatable content. If I’m struggling with school, I shoot that. If I’m sick, I  shoot that. That’s what most of my audience relate and so much more. `] },
        {question: "How do you stay consistent without burning out creatively?", answer: [`Consistency is something that I’m still struggling with in my journey but I’m working on it. How I’m working on it is, I edit while I shoot so that I am able to drop videos on time because usually, the reason why I can’t drop is because I never find time to edit because there is school going on. `] },
        {question: "As a male in the creative space, what challenges have you faced, if any?", answer: [`Not much honestly but the society is sometimes judgemental when as a man you show how you take good care of yourself in your vlogs. For instance ,you might receive backlash for having skin care in your morning routine. It never got to me though, but it’s the closest thing to challenges I face as a man in the creative space. `] },
        {question: "Do you think male creatives are represented enough in the industry?", answer: [`There isn’t a lot of men in the space but I do think they are coming in. The representation is picking up.`] },
        {question: "What do you think the industry needs more of, especially when it comes to young men?", answer: [`I don’t think the industry needs to do anything, I think male creatives need to show that they can do anything. The only way for the industry to see something as normal is if it’s done consistently until it becomes a norm. `] },
        {question: "What does success look like to you as a creative?", answer: [`Finding your niche is what success looks like to me. `] },
        {question: "Who are your creative inspirations locally or globally?", answer: [`Thato Rampedi locally and  Logan Robles, also know as Lough, internationally. `] },
        {question: "How do your roots or background influence your work?", answer: [`They help me stay grounded and authentic. They also prevent burnout because there’s a lot of untold stories about where I come from. `] },
        {question: "What's your ultimate dream project?", answer: [`The ultimate dream project is to shoot a Netflix series. `] },
        {question: "As a man in the creative industry, do you feel free to express your emotions without being judged?", answer: [`Social media/industry is all nice but I am never comfortable with emotional expression on it. I do believe as a creative you need to have a space for that which does not involve the industry. Have friends/family that you can talk to. People on social media only see what you let them see and not everything and that may influence their biases on your emotions. `] },
        {question: `Do you feel like there's pressure for men to "have it all figured out"? How do you deal with that?`, answer: [`I do think that pressure will always be there and it is very important. It keeps me on my toes but also I know when to draw the line because I don’t want to find myself in situations where I’m overwhelmed because I want to have everything figured because that is what the society expects. `] },
        {question: "What's a truth you've had to accept about yourself in order to grow creatively and personally?", answer: [`The truth I’ve had to accept is that there’s nothing new under the sun, so I never have to crack my head trying to come up with something ‘new’. I just find inspiration from something that’s already there and creating my interpretation of it.`] }

I was surrounded by creatives  almost all my friends were into some form of art  and that environment made me fall deeper in love with creativity. The idea of creating something out of nothing has always fascinated me. My journey into graphic design started back in high school, just experimenting with designs on my phone and later using my brother’s computer. One of my first real projects was designing a logo for a friend who was a DJ  I used Microsoft Paint at the time. That moment, along with the influence of my brother who was a music producer, opened up a world of creative tools and ideas for me. While he focused on music, I found my own lane in visual art and design. I now work across different areas like branding, motion graphics, and packaging  constantly learning and growing"},
        {question: "Creative Process & Style", answer: `My design style is a mix of old and new. I love finding old artwork and taking inspiration or samples from it  there’s something powerful about reviving vintage aesthetics in a modern way. Most of the time, I don’t plan too much. I just start designing, and ideas begin to flow on their own until I end up with a final piece, sometimes without even realizing it. I try not to overthink or compare my work to others, because that can block creativity. I draw inspiration from everything  music, culture, people, conversations, and random moments. It all plays a role in how I create. My go-to tools are Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator, I honestly see them as therapy. They’re part of my everyday process and I can’t imagine designing without them`},
        {question: "Thoughts & Challenges", answer: ["One of the most challenging areas I’ve worked in is corporate branding. It’s not just about the design  it’s the pressure, constant updates, meetings, and the level of professionalism required. When I hit a creative block, I don’t force it. I simply take a break from my laptop and let the ideas come naturally. I definitely feel misunderstood at times, especially when working with clients who don’t fully get the design process. Many feel the need to add something just to feel involved, even if it compromises the vision."] },
        {question: "Design Mindset", answer: [`For me, the key is keeping things simple. If the design delivers the message clearly, then it’s doing its job. I’ve always leaned toward minimalism.
My favorite part of creating posters is just being in the moment. When I’m designing, time moves fast. I don’t overthink  it’s like therapy, and the best part is I get paid to do what I love.
I draw inspiration from past artworks. There are many designers I admire, even if I can’t name all of them off the top of my head. But names like Screezus, Karabo Poppy, and Malepa definitely stand out for me.`] },
        {question: "Collaboration & Culture", answer: ["Being part of Matjita Mag means a lot to me. We’re building something that uplifts the hood and inspires upcoming creatives. It shows others that they can do it too. What satisfies me most is giving upcoming creators a platform to tell their own stories. That alone makes the work worth it. Design plays a huge role in storytelling. You don’t always need words to express something. A strong visual can often say more than a sentence ever could. That’s why we have billboards and posters they speak to people fast and powerfully." ] },
        {question: "Goals & Vision", answer: [`One of my dream projects is to create a gallery studio where I can explore ideas freely without any limitations. A space where I can turn creative concepts into things people can connect with whether that’s through clothing or other forms of design.` ] },
        {question: "Bonus: Just for Fun", answer: [`Something people don’t always realize about graphic designers is that we constantly feel like we don’t know enough. There’s always this urge to keep learning, improving, and evolving.`] },
